# Anime Analysis and Recommandations

The purpose of this application is to use data about anime containing popular opinion and show things that may be interesting to create new recommendations for those looking for new animes and to analyse some interesting thing about animes and get conclusions.

I was just trying to train some skills using things that I like so this idea came up.

The app uses a data from the year 2020 from the MyAnimeList website.

I did an EDA on the dataframe then I used streamlit to show some interesting data and try to give ideas for anime recommendations.
