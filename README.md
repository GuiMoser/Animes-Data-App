# Anime Analysis and Recommandations Data App

## Project Description
The purpose of this application is to use data about anime containing popular opinion and show things that may be interesting to create new recommendations for those looking for new animes and to analyse some interesting thing about animes and get conclusions.

The app uses a data from the year 2020 from the MyAnimeList website.

The notebook performs an EDA on the dataframe then use python and streamlit to create the web app and show some interesting data and to give ideas for anime recommendations.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis.
- Create a web app using Streamlit to display the results of the analysis.
- Provide recommendations for anime based on user input.
- Display interesting data about anime.
- Get conclusions about anime.

## Tools and Libs used
- Python: Main language used for analysis.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
- Streamlit: Library for creating web apps.
- Plotly: Library for creating visualizations.
- Render: Platform to deploy the web app.

## Methodology
#### EDA
- Import libraries.
- Load the dataframes.
#### Preprocessing
- Identify and treat missing values.
#### Data Analysis
- Calculate summary statistics.
- Create visualizations to understand the data distribution.
#### Recommendations
- Use the most popular animes to recommend anime based on genres, ratings, score and favorites.
#### Web App
- Create a Streamlit app to display the results of the analysis and recommendations.

## Conclusions
- After all the analysis, we can conclude that the best safe choices to launch or announce a new anime are animes containing the Action or Comedy genre, which may contain subgenres such as Shonen or Drama, and have few episodes so that more people can watch. If you are working with films, Romance and Drama films are best rated. Some more distinct genres can also be successful, such as Thriller, Scifi and Mystery, as well as long animes can also be exceptions, being in the Shonen genre.

## Learnings
- Data analysis: interpreting and extracting valuable insights from large volumes of data.
- Data cleaning: identifying and correcting missing, duplicate, and anomalous values.
- Creating graphics: using matplotlib and seaborn to visualize data in an intuitive and informative way.
- Data preprocessing: preparing data for analysis, including cleaning and treat the data.
- Use of libraries and tools: practical application of various libraries and tools from the Python ecosystem, such as Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Data-driven decision making: Using insights derived from data analysis to guide strategic decisions.
